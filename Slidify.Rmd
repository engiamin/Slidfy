## What is Evolutionary Game Theory?

- Evolution is concerned with the way populations change over time. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) employs techniques from mathematics, social sciences and biology to study the change of a population of agents with different strategies or traits.


- It combines the viewpoint of game theory of autonomous players having to take strategic decisions, and the viewpoint of evolutionary population dynamics where successful strategies increase their frequencies.

## Model Description

This application provides an interactive platform to explore a simple 2x2 prisoner's dilemma game with only 2 strategies: Coooperate and Defect. [Click here for more information](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/)

```{r gamepic, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("dilemma-prisoners.jpg")
```



## Experimenting with Application

1.Insert the following parameters to the application:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Image 1.png")
```

2.The following replicator equation is run:

$$ p^{o} = p (\pi_{Cooperate} - \overline{\pi}))  $$

```{r, echo=F}
Replicator_plot <- function (t,p,parameters){
    R <- parameters [1]
    Pun <- parameters [2]
    Tr <- parameters [3]
    S <- parameters [4]
    dp <- p*(S - Pun) + p**2*(R - Tr - 2*S + 2*Pun) + p**3*(S + Tr - Pun - R)
    list(dp)
  } 
```


***

3.Finally, the following phase portrait is rendered:

```{r, echo=T,fig.height=3, fig.width=3,message=F,error=F, size="tiny"}
plot1 <- phasePortrait(Replicator_plot, ylim = c(0, 1),
                   parameters = c(-1,-5,0,-20), 
                   points = 10,xlab = "Proportion of Cooperators", ylab = "Change (dp)",
                   lwd=4)
```

This plot shows that the population will ALWAYS converge to the strategy "defect" and cooperation will decay!
